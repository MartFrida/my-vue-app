This application is for the car rental service in Ukraine.

The application consists of 3 pages:
Home page with a general description of the services provided by the company.
A page containing a catalog of cars of various configurations, which the user can filter by brand.
A page with ads that have been added to favorites by the user.
There is also navigation through pages and viewports.

If you click on the button in the form of a "heart" on the ad card, it is added to the list of favorites, and the color of the button changes.
If you click the heart button again, the ad is removed from the list of favorites, and the color of the button changes to its original state.
If you click on the Learn more button, a modal window opens with detailed information about the car and its rental conditions.
The modal window is closed by clicking on the button in the form of a "cross", by clicking on the backdrop or pressing the Esc key.
The Rental car button allows the user to connect with the company by phone number +380730000000.
Added dropdown filtering with car brands.
When you refresh the Favorites page, your favorite ads remain until you delete them.
